# Analysis of Calais Staple Trade Fluctuations (1492–1497)

## Summary

This analysis examines the volume and value of woollen cloth exported through the Calais Staple during the period 1492–1497, a time marked by significant diplomatic and military events in Henry VII’s England. Using the trade ledger data, we quantify year‑on‑year changes in exports and identify the most pronounced disruption, linking it to the Cornish Rebellion of 1497.

## Data Overview

The dataset includes entries for Calais exports of two cloth types (Broadcloth and Kersey) to France and the Low Countries. The table below aggregates total units exported and total value (in pounds) for each year:

| Year | Total Units Exported | Total Value (£) |
|------|----------------------|-----------------|
| 1492 | 2,000                | 3,600           |
| 1493 | 2,100                | 3,800           |
| 1494 | 2,200                | 4,000           |
| 1495 | 2,300                | 4,200           |
| 1496 | 2,400                | 4,400           |
| 1497 | 1,400                | 2,500           |

## Year‑on‑Year Changes

- **1492→1493**: +100 units (+5.0%), +£200 (+5.6%)
- **1493→1494**: +100 units (+4.8%), +£200 (+5.3%)
- **1494→1495**: +100 units (+4.5%), +£200 (+5.0%)
- **1495→1496**: +100 units (+4.3%), +£200 (+4.8%)
- **1496→1497**: –1,000 units (–41.7%), –£1,900 (–43.2%)

The figures reveal a steady, moderate growth from 1492 to 1496, followed by a sharp contraction in 1497.

## Most Significant Disruption

The year 1497 stands out as the period of greatest volatility. Exports fell by more than 40% in both volume and value compared with the preceding year. This collapse coincides with the Cornish Rebellion of 1497, a major popular uprising against Henry VII’s war taxation. The rebellion disrupted internal transport, diverted government resources toward military suppression, and likely eroded merchant confidence, all of which would have curtailed the flow of woollen cloth through the Calais Staple.

## Historical Context

The earlier years of the period show consistent growth, possibly reflecting the stabilising effect of the Treaty of Étaples (1492). That treaty ended the French war and secured English holdings in France, creating a more predictable environment for cross‑Channel trade. However, the rebellion of 1497 demonstrates how domestic unrest could swiftly undermine the benefits of foreign‑policy stability. Henry VII’s need to raise emergency funds—through forced loans, debasement, or higher tariffs—would have placed additional burdens on the merchants who financed the woollen trade, further depressing export activity.

## Conclusion

The Calais Staple data illustrates the delicate interplay between diplomacy, domestic politics, and economic performance in late‑15th‑century England. While the Treaty of Étaples appears to have fostered a gradual expansion of the woollen trade, the Cornish Rebellion of 1497 caused a dramatic, short‑term contraction. This episode underscores a broader drawback of relying heavily on foreign trade: when domestic crises demand fiscal and military resources, the export‑oriented sectors are often the first to suffer.
